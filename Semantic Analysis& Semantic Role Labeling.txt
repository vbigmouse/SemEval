Semantic Analysis:
	1. Process of relating syntactic structures from small levels like phrases, clauses, 
	   sentences and paragraphs to level of writing as whole language-independent meanings.
	   
	2. Also involves removing particular linguistic and cultural contexts. 
	   E.g idiom and figurative speech will convert to relative invariant meaning in semantic analysis.
	   
	Semantic Analysis Process:
		1. Begin with the relationship between individual words. E.g. synonyms, antonyms...
		2. Relates to concepts which is cobinationn of words frequently surrounding a single word. E.g idioms, metaphor..
			Idioms Example:“ white as a ghost”


Semantic Role Labeling:
	Detection of semantic arguments associated with the predicate or verb of a sentence and their classification:
	
	What is Semantic Role? : Express the abstract role that arguments of a predicate can take in event.
	For example, given a sentence like 
	"Mary sold the book to John", the task would be to recognize:
	"to sell" as representing the predicate, 
	"Mary" as representing the seller (agent), 
	"the book" as representing the goods (theme), 
	"John" as representing the recipient. 
	
This is an important step towards making sense of the meaning of a sentence.
